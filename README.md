# YoutubeDateFinder

This is a web application that allows you to search for YouTube videos by date. You can type what you want to find, and select a range of dates in which the video was uploaded.

The Youtube video finder is being developed with AngularJS and Angular Material for the front-end, and NodeJS with ExpressJS for the backend. This application will employ the Google's Youtube searcher API.

It's intended to be deployed on Heroku.

Thanks! :)
